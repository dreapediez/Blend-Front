# Blend Project:

## Introduction:

Blend is a project created with the main objective to complement an Advent Christmas Calendar product with a digital experience. In Blend you can add a new tea post daily, share a photo and a summary to improve the classic advent calendar experience.
This project has been created in order to develop all the skills and abilities that I have learned over the past two and a half months at the bootcamp ISDI Coders, thanks to the teacher and senior Web Developer Mario González Lendínez.
